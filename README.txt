CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION - IN TELECOM INDUSTRY
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom sector using machine learning models, 
helping businesses identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.

Documents in this `project` folder includes:-

Project Summery Documents:
